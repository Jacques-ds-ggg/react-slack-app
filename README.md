# React-Framework-Slack-web-app
This is my custom version of the **Slack proprietary business communication platform** developed by American software company **Slack Technologies**.

The web app is created using the **react-framework** and not only **hosted on firebase** for database functionallity, but with added **firebase authentication** to allow google users to sign in and leave a message.
The frontend-UI is designed with with a strong resemblance of the original slack workspace with added unique colors to make it stand out a little more.

### Please note:
> The firebase-chat-hosting-functionallty will expire in March 2021 due to the 30day trail

### CleverProgrammer Coaching
- This project was part of a **5-day-react-challenge** hosted by the team at CleverProgrammer to allow individuals to participate in the challenge and working together in a **community** to build a complex web-app from scratch and add it to your **portfolio**.
- The project covered loads of **Full-Stack-Development** frameworks to enable individuals to start a career in Full-Stack-Dev as a freelancer or as a **Full-Time** employee at a high level startup or company.
- The project started with installing all the required frameworks and code-editors to get a blank react-app initilized to start editing.
- Once the blank-app is active, **Live** coding the frontend of the **slack-communication-web-app**, allows the web-app to come alive while your typing each line after the previous.
- Next will be the firebase-database with the user-authentication enabled to allow users to sign in and have their Profile, Name, Time sent and the message itself, stored in the database to allow a cloud base messaging environment integrated in the app.
  - Users can sign-in, back out and in again - all while sending a message for the other users to read.
  - All the messages will be stored with the corresponding username, profile, and time sent stored in a clasified channels field within the database.
  - Messages can easilly be retrieved and listed in the channel room with the name, time and profile of each sender added with each message to allow community communication.
  - Signing=in requires a valid google account for easy sign-in and namretrieval to be stored with the message's sent in the selected channel.
